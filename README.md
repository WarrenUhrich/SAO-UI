# Sword Art Online (SAO) User Interface (UI) Experiment

## Goal

Reproduce the message modal as it appears in the anime: Sword Art Online.

Here is a sample image:

## Version 1 Versus Version 2

Here are some GIFs of this project's functionality. The first is the upgraded version you'll find today, and the latter is the original from ten years ago:

## How to Try it Out

Visit the [experiment web page here](https://warrenuhrich.github.io/SAO-UI/). You'll click the mouse, and drag down (or just swipe down on a touch screen) for the UI elements to appear. Once they have, you can click on them to reveal a dynamic message box. Each option in the UI will open a different message box. Once any message box is closed, the UI can be hidden again by swiping up.

## Reflection

Hi there, I'm [Warren Uhrich](https://warren.codes). Today is September 17, 2024, and I'm looking back at my journey as a web developer. December 14, 2014 I had published this repository and to-date it has the most watches, forks, and stars of any that I've made public. No doubt this is a result of the anime [Sword Art Online](https://www.swordart-online.net/)'s incredible popularity at that time.

Today I have revisited this little project. It was small and pretty unassuming, but was a fun exercise. In my revisiting I've re-coded it while trying to keep the spirit of the original approach, with a couple of modern improvements including touch screen support.

Please, have a look and enjoy: [https://warrenuhrich.github.io/SAO-UI/](https://warrenuhrich.github.io/SAO-UI/)
